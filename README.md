# 👋 Hi, I'm Mehmed Bashov

### From Leading Global Infrastructure Projects to Building Web Applications with JavaScript

I'm a **JavaScript developer** with a background in managing large-scale infrastructure projects for Microsoft, Google, and Meta across Europe. After transitioning from project leadership to web development, I’ve trained at **SoftUni** and built scalable full-stack applications, leveraging **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js/Express** with **MongoDB** on the backend.

My goal is to build clean, scalable, and maintainable web applications that solve real-world problems.
